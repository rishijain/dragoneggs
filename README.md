The story goes like this:

You are being faced with the daunting task of saving the world from the deadly dragon eggs. You have to drop those eggs in such a way that they fall into a basket, if they fall upon earth, the egg will break and a baby dragon would be born. Then, there is no one who could save this world from the fury of dragons, not even HULK. 
It is your chance to be a super-hero. Get the inner avenger out and save all of us. May God be with you.
